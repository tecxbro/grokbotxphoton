# Providers

> Choose, configure, and combine Spectrum platform providers.

SDK providers plug into Spectrum's type system and runtime. Each SDK provider
exports a callable. Call `provider.config(...)` to register it, and call
`provider(app)` or `provider(space)` to
[narrow](/docs/spectrum-ts/platform-narrowing) into its platform-specific instance.

## Platform and provider guides

Most platforms connect through a provider package registered with `config()`.
Voice calls currently connect directly over SIP; the Voice guide lives here
because it is a platform integration, while SDK call control is still on the
roadmap.

## Combining providers

Call each provider's `config()` method and pass the results to `providers`:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Aggregate import">
    ```ts theme={null}
    import { Spectrum } from "spectrum-ts";
    import { imessage, terminal, whatsappBusiness } from "spectrum-ts/providers";

    const app = await Spectrum({
      projectId: "...",
      projectSecret: "...",
      providers: [
        imessage.config(),
        whatsappBusiness.config({
          accessToken: process.env.WA_TOKEN!,
          phoneNumberId: process.env.WA_NUMBER_ID!,
          appSecret: process.env.WA_SECRET!,
        }),
        terminal.config(),
      ],
    });
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Individual imports">
    ```ts theme={null}
    import { Spectrum } from "spectrum-ts";
    import { imessage } from "spectrum-ts/providers/imessage";
    import { terminal } from "spectrum-ts/providers/terminal";
    import { whatsappBusiness } from "spectrum-ts/providers/whatsapp-business";

    const app = await Spectrum({
      projectId: "...",
      projectSecret: "...",
      providers: [
        imessage.config(),
        whatsappBusiness.config({
          accessToken: process.env.WA_TOKEN!,
          phoneNumberId: process.env.WA_NUMBER_ID!,
          appSecret: process.env.WA_SECRET!,
        }),
        terminal.config(),
      ],
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

`app.messages` merges messages from every provider. The `message.platform` field tells you which provider delivered each message.

<Note>
  `@spectrum-ts/imessage-local` is not part of the aggregate import. Install it
  explicitly and import `localIMessage` from its scoped package. Cloud iMessage
  uses the `"imessage"` platform ID; local iMessage uses `"local_imessage"`, so
  a macOS application can register both when it needs both transports.
</Note>

## Writing your own

If none of the built-ins fit, implement a provider with `definePlatform`. See [Building a custom platform](/docs/spectrum-ts/custom-platforms).
