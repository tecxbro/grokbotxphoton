# Unsend

> Retract a previously sent outbound message.

Use `unsend()` to retract a previously sent outbound message. Unsends are fire-and-forget: `space.send(unsend(...))` resolves to `undefined`.

```ts theme={null}
import { unsend } from "spectrum-ts";

const sent = await space.send("Oops");
await space.send(unsend(sent));
```

`message.unsend()` and `space.unsend(message)` are sugar for `space.send(unsend(message))`.

Only outbound messages can be unsent. The builder throws at build time for inbound targets. Platform constraints, such as iMessage's roughly two-minute unsend window for regular messages, surface from the provider at send time.
